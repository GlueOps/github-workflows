# Release Process

- Create a PR, get 1 or more approvals and then Merge to main
- Create a tag with the date format of YYYYMMDD and prefix it with a v. If today is April 20, 2023 the tag would be v20230420
- The tag allows people to roll back to some point in time in case their reference `@main` stops working because of a bad change or an upstream issue.
